# Assignment

1. Title of Research: "Economic and Social Cost of the Opioid Crisis in the US: A State Level Analysis Using Panel Data". 
2. In Section 10 of iLearn, I post a few research reports and papers for you to read. They are all easy read. Please read them to frame the research question around the above title of the project. 
3. We need cost data, specifically public costs (Medicare plus Medicaid) data for each state from 2000 to 2018. We also need data on annual opioid deaths and data on state level socio-demographic factors. I will send you some possible data leads in a few days. 
4. You need to submit a two-page research abstract by Sunday, April 5, 11:00 pm. 

# Other Notes from Dr. CHattopadhyay
1. Check out a laptop for 30 Days from the 1st floor Research Commons in the Library
  Tues. 3/17 between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
  Wed 3/18 between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., as long as laptops are available
2. Face-to-face (in class) instructions may not happen for the rest of the spring semester. 
3. Because of the current disruption, Smart Growth project write up submission deadline is now pushed to Sunday, March 29, 11:00 pm. 
4. Read the five OPIOID articles I posted on iLearn to make yourself ready for a two-page abstract. Although you are in groups, but this two-pager is an individual effort. 
5. Soon I will send some leads for possible sources of opioid-related data collection.
